# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Notes
My app was working perfectly fine until it suddenly stopped working. I'm not sure where the issue is coming from I have been trying to debug for hours but still nothing. I think it might be an issue with the database and not with the code. Currently, only the delete is working as it's supposed to. Can I please get some feedback on why it might not be working that would be greatly appreciated.
